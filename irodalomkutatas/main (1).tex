\section{Introduction}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into qualitative research has emerged as a rapidly evolving field, promising enhanced efficiency, methodological innovation, and greater analytical consistency. Recent scholarship illustrates a growing agreement that advanced computational tools such as large language models (LLMs), and machine learning algorithms have the potential to significantly automate and augment structural qualitative analysis, while generating new questions around reliability, transparency, and interpretive depth \cite{Nicmanis2025, Parfenova2024}. As qualitative data proliferates and research contexts become more complex, the automation of analysis offers answers to longstanding practical challenges while raising new theoretical dilemmas that require careful and systematic study.

Artificial intelligence–assisted qualitative analysis now has two major traditions. On one hand, positivist or "Small-q" approaches seek clarity, replicability, and standardized coding processes, leveraging the strengths of computational models for routine tasks such as content classification, code network mapping, and metric derivation. On the other hand, constructivist or "Big-Q" traditions in qualitative research emphasize researcher reflexivity, context sensitivity, and the interpretive openness required for meaningful analysis of complex social and psychological phenomena \cite{Nicmanis2025, BraunClarke2006}. The recent guide by Nicmanis and Spurrier (2025) articulates an approach-based framework for qualitative analysis, demonstrating how AI can be flexibly integrated into both reflexive and more mechanical workflows \cite{Nicmanis2025}. In their work they argue that AI must be treated as a "team member" rather than a replacement, especially in the context of collaborative coding and analytic reflection.

Automating the "structural" layer of qualitative analysis—sometimes referred to as code-space modeling, theme extraction, and relational mapping—has become especially promising. Chen et al. (2024) proposed an innovative computational method for measuring "open codes," constructing multidimensional code spaces that enable quantitative comparison between human and AI-generated analytic outputs \cite{Chen2024}. This method builds directly on grounded theory's principles of iterative coding and concept aggregation as described by Corbin and Strauss (1990), using network-based metrics to assess coverage, novelty, and divergence between coder groups \cite{CorbinStrauss1990}. Such developments position AI not only as a transcription or data-processing tool but as an agent capable of substantive analytic contribution.

The reliability of AI-assisted coding and the interpretive integrity of such processes remain critical points for further exploration. Bijker et al. (2024) provide empirical evidence for the use of ChatGPT in automated qualitative research, demonstrating substantial reductions in time and workload while noting modest differences in inductive coding outcomes between AI and human researchers \cite{Bijker2024}. Their study points to the importance of transparency, reproducibility, and ethical considerations in deploying AI—issues also emphasized by Braun and Clarke's foundational work on thematic analysis, which underscores the necessity of clear procedures and explicit reporting in qualitative studies \cite{BraunClarke2006}. Bijker's findings suggest that while current large language models provide robust scaffolding for certain analytic tasks, their outputs must be critically assessed for context sensitivity, especially in reflexive thematic domains.

Recent technical developments have expanded the possibilities for automated qualitative analysis. Parfenova et al. (2024) propose a comprehensive automation pipeline for qualitative coding using LLMs, incorporating shared datasets and rigorous benchmarking to support reproducible science \cite{Parfenova2024}. Their approach synthesizes deep learning and topic modeling, offering new avenues for scalable, interpretable, and cross-contextual analysis. The challenge, as identified by Guest et al. (2020), lies in ensuring thematic "saturation" and analytic completeness while maintaining flexibility for emergent codes and themes \cite{Guest2020}. The convergence of machine learning, collaborative epistemology, and thematic rigor forms the basis for a new generation of qualitative methodologies.

Early theoretical proposals, such as Hoxtell's (2019), have argued for the necessity of open data strategies and interoperable software platforms to support semi-automated content analysis at scale \cite{Hoxtell2019}. As new empirical studies expand what is possible, the field faces a dual imperative: first, to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of qualitative research through automation, and second, to critically examine the interpretive and ethical implications of delegating analytic responsibility to machines. These concerns are particularly relevant as AI tools become more sophisticated and their outputs more difficult to distinguish from human-generated analysis.

This new study, inspired by recent methodological guides and empirical findings, will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining in-depth analysis of simulated and real-world qualitative data with controlled comparisons of human and AI-generated outputs. Ultimately, the study seeks to clarify current capabilities and future directions in AI-assisted qualitative research, contributing novel insights on the balance between automation and interpretive rigor.
